Constructors can accept a std::vector with vertices or a std::set with vertices

Functions:

addEdge(Type x, Type y)
- add an edge between vertices x and y
- if one of x and y is an invalid vertex, then will throw an error
- if there's already an edge between x and y, the function will do nothing

removeEdge(Type x, Type y)
- removes the edge between vertices x and y
- if one of x and y is an invalid vertex, then will throw an error
- if there's no edge between, the function will do nothing

unsigned int size()
- returns the number of vertices

unsigned int degree(Type x)
- returns the out degree of vertex x
- throws an error is x is an invalid vertex

std::set<Type> getNeighbours(Type x)
- returns a std::set<Type> will all out neighbours of vertex x
- throws an error if x is an invalid vertex

std::set<Type> getOutNeighbours(Type x)
- does the same thing as getNeighbours
- works only on io_directed_graph<Type>

std::set<Type> getInNeighbours(Type x)
- returns a std::set<Type> will all in neighbours of vertex x
- throws an error if x is an invalid vertex
- works only on io_directed_graph<Type>

unsigned int outDegree(Type x)
- does the same thing as degree
- works only on io_directed_graph<Type>

unsigned int inDegree(Type x)
- returns the in degree of vertex x
- throws an error is x is an invalid vertex
- works only on io_directed_graph<Type>
